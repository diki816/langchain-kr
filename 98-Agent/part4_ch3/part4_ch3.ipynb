Christian Monsod said there was no need for the President to call for a special session of Congress to make way for the convening of the Senate as an impeachment court.\\nFurther, the constitutional framer said that the legislative break is a \"recess that can be terminated\" for \"something that is very important given to the Senate to undertake.\"\\nMonsod, the chairman of the Constitutional Commission\\'s Committee on the Accountability of Public Officers, indicated that the requirement to convene the impeachment court \"forthwith\" as provided by the constitution meant having to do so \"immediately.\"\\n\"Therefore, the faster it is resolved the better because one of the main purposes of the impeachment proceeding is to protect the right, protect people from the wrong officials who do not deserve office. So the faster the proceedings go, the better for the people,\" Monsod said.\\nHe explained that special mandates provided by the constitution to the Senate, like convening the impeachment court, is \"self-executory\" and not covered by other provisions that refer to the Senate\\'s legislative functions.\\nArticle XI Section 3(4) of the 1987 Constitution which stated that \"In case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the Members of the House, the same shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment, and trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed.\"\\n\"The provision about the president can call a special session is for the legislative function of the Senate. It does not refer to this special mandate of the constitution which is self-executory. It is addressed to the Senate, they have the duty and the\\xa0obligation to obey the constitution,\" he said.\\nSenate President Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero has been firm that the impeachment court will only be convened once the Senate is in session, saying he is proceeding with the impeachment process \"legally, constitutionally, and in accordance with law.\"\\nOn Thursday, Escudero released a timeline tentatively setting the start of the impeachment trial of Duterte on July 30.\\nIn a letter to his colleagues dated February 24, Escudero explained why he was firm that the impeachment trial should start while Congress is in session and not in a special session.\\nHe cited jurisprudence and precedents to support his interpretation of the word \"forthwith\" in tackling impeachment cases under the 1987 Constitution.\\n\"As the head of this institution, I am most cognizant of the Constitutional mandate that vests in the Senate the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment. This is an extraordinary duty that should be approached with all due caution and prudence, not to mention adequate preparation\" Escudero said in his letter.\\nEscudero cited the position of the late former Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago during the endorsement of the impeachment of then President Joseph Ejecito Estrada, who argued that \"while the Senate must proceed \\'forthwith\\', it must do so with circumspection.\"\\nEscudero also mentioned Santiago\\'s assertion that the constitutional provision requiring the Senate to \"proceed forthwith\" was taken out of context and should instead be read in conjunction with Article XI, Section 3(8) of the Constitution which states that \"the Congress shall promulgate its rules on impeachment to effectively carry out the purpose of this Section.\"\\nHe noted that the Senate back then took Santiago\\'s position and only issued the summons after the resolution on the Rules of Procedure on Impeachment Trials was adopted.\\nThe House impeached Duterte on February 5, with over 200 lawmakers endorsing the complaint. The Articles of Impeachment were transmitted to the Senate the same day, but the upper chamber adjourned without addressing the case.\\nDuterte has filed a Supreme Court petition challenging the validity of the impeachment complaint.\\nLawyers from Mindanao and other groups have also asked the SC to stop the trial, calling the complaint defective.\\nAnother petition is seeking to compel the Senate to convene as an impeachment court immediately.\\nTags: VP Sara Duterte, vp sara duterte impeachment, Christian Monsod, impeachment court, Chiz Escudero\\nMore Videos\\nMost Popular\\nLOADING CONTENT\\nLOAD MORE ARTICLES\\nRETRY LOADING\\n◀\\nAll Rights Reserved 2025\\n© GMA Network Inc.\\nAll Rights Reserved 2025 © GMA Network Inc.\\nAbout GMA News Online\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nAdvertise with Us\\nCareers\\nPrivacy Notice\\nURL Policy\\nAI Policy\\nUser Policy\\nOn TV\\nGMA-7 Shows\\nGMA News TV Shows\\nTV Schedule\\nNews\\nNews\\nMoney\\nSports\\nPinoy Abroad\\nSciTech\\nShowbiz\\nLifestyle\\nOpinion\\nHashtag\\nSerbisyo Publiko\\nCommunity Bulletin Board\\nTracking\\nCover Stories\\nEleksyon 2022\\nCOVID-19 Full Coverage\\nNews\\nNews\\nMoney\\nSports\\nPinoy Abroad\\nSciTech\\nShowbiz\\nLifestyle\\nOpinion\\nHashtag\\nSerbisyo Publiko\\nCommunity Bulletin Board\\nTracking\\nCover Stories\\nEleksyon 2022\\nCOVID-19 Full Coverage\\nMultimedia\\nVideos\\nPhotos\\nRadio -- DZBB\\nStay Connected\\nRSS Feed\\nMobile\\nSocial Media Center\\nTools\\nSearch\\nStories\\nGMANetwork.com\\nEntertainment\\nArtist Center\\nCommunity\\nInternational\\nRadio\\nPictures\\nMusic\\nKapuso Foundation\\nCorporate\\nRegional TV\\nGMANetwork.com\\nEntertainment\\nArtist Center\\nCommunity\\nInternational\\nRadio\\nPictures\\nMusic\\nKapuso Foundation\\nCorporate\\nRegional TV'}, {'title': 'President Trump’s moves test the limits of presidential power and the resilience of US democracy -

(Justin Wan/Lincoln Journal Star via AP)\\nBy Nicholas Riccardi | Associated Press\\nUPDATED: March 1, 2025 at 12:04 PM CST\\nDuring his first six weeks in office, President Donald Trumphas embarked on a dizzying teardown of the federal government and attacks on long-standing institutions in an attempt to increase his own authority.\\nHe has pardoned those who attacked the U.S. Capitol to overturn his 2020 election loss, placed loyalists atop the FBIand military, and purged the Department of Justice, which dropped investigations against Trump allies. He declared control over independent agencies such as the Federal Elections Commission, punished media outlets for coverage he dislikes and his allies suggested he could defy court orders.\\nThose who monitor democracy across the globe had warned that a second Trump term could endanger America’s 240-year experiment with democracy. His opening weeks in office have done nothing to dispel those concerns.\\n“Trump is using the classic elected authoritarian playbook,” said Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College, who joined more than 800 other political scientists in signing a letter warning that Trump is undermining the rule of law and the basic constitutional principle of checks and balances. “It’s almost embarrassing how crude it is.”\\nNyhan said some of Trump’s moves echo those made by others who won democratic elections and then moved to centralize control, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orban. Those who have resisted authoritarians in other countries say they are alarmed by what is happening in the United States.\\n“I feel like I’m living through this twice,” said Maria Ressa, a journalist who won a Nobel Prize after being prosecuted by the government of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in 2019, on a call last week about the threat of Trump to democracy.\\n“What you’re seeing is exactly that — think about it as death by a thousand cuts,” she said. “You’re bleeding so much that, at some point, the body politic dies.”\\n‘What democracy is all about’\\nTrump has certainly embraced the image of a strongman.\\nThe president declared, “we are the federal law” and posted on his social media site that “He who saves his country does not violate any law” — a quote often attributed to Napolean Bonaparte. The official White House account posted on the social media site X an image of a smiling, crowned Trump with the words “LONG LIVE THE KING.”\\nTrump’s supporters say he actually is trying to preserve American democracy by giving voters what they want — a strong president. How strong Trump can become is in question. Courts have paused several of his executive orders, including ones seeking to eliminate agencies created by Congress and ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally.\\nTrump campaigned last year promising to dismantle what he contends is a corrupt government bureaucracy, which he blames for failures during his first term and his subsequent prosecution. On his first day in office, the new president told reporters his goal was to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office in February, billionaire Elon Musk, who Trump tapped to spearhead cuts to the federal government, claimed he is the one trying to “restore democracy.” Some of the lawsuits seeking to stop Musk’s actions have been unsuccessful, allowing him to proceed.\\n“The people voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get,” Musk told reporters. “That’s what democracy is all about.”\\nBut many who track democracy warn that Musk’s conception is incomplete.\\n“The power you gain through the ballot box is not unlimited power. That’s the essence of liberal democracy,” said Kevin Casas-Zamora, secretary general of the Stockholm-based pro-democracy group International IDEA.\\n‘Undermining our democratic traditions’\\nOn the world stage, Trump and his administration have alarmed longtime allies in Europe over whether the U.S. remains committed to NATO and his siding with Russia in talks to end the war in Ukraine, a country the Kremlin invaded three years ago, and at the United Nations last month.\\nOn Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Russian officials and many Trump allies expressed glee; European nations reacted in horror.\\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the close relations between the Trump administration and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government amounted to an existential threat. “This Putin-Trump alliance means abandoning our allies, supporting authoritarianism and undermining our democratic traditions,” he said in a social media post.\\nThe common theme throughout Trump’s moves is about expanding his personal power, said Josh Chafetz, a Georgetown law professor.\\n“It’s not even clear what it’s power in service of,” he added, noting that Trump has few strong ideological convictions.\\nPoliticizing federal law enforcement\\nDespite concerns that the administration would disregard the judiciary, Trump and Musk said it would obey court rulings and eventually seek congressional approval for the changes they are making. Still, Musk and some other Republicans have also called for impeaching judges who rule against the administration.\\nThere are plenty of other warning signs, chiefly the aggressive use of the Department of Justice to promote Trump’s political interests.\\nThe department directed prosecutors to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, citing his cooperation with the administration’s immigration crackdown. That led to several senior Justice Department officials resigning after saying such a deal was dangerous and some former top prosecutors warning about the risks to the rule of law.\\nTrump’s pick to be U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, represented some defendants who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Martin, in his interim post as the top federal prosecution in the nation’s capital, contacted at least two congressional Democrats,including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, to “investigate” previous statements they had made. One statement related to Musk and another dealt with the conservative Supreme Court justices who were in the majority ruling that ended the constitutional right to abortion.\\n“This notion that you can use your power to reward your friends and punish your enemies — it reminds me of something that has long been a staple of Latin American politics,” said Casas-Zamora, who is from Costa Rica.\\nThreatening perceived enemies\\nTrump has escalated attacks on media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, kicking them out of their Pentagon workspace or barring them from the Oval Office and Air Force One and picking which will be allowed to cover his events. His appointee to head the Federal Communications Commission is investigating PBS and National Public Radio, which receive federal money.\\nTrump also issued an executive order to take control of independent agencies such as the FCC, Federal Election Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nSome leading Democrats have used striking analogies in warning about Trump’s actions. In a State of the State address last month that ended with a scathing assessment of Trump’s actions, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, who is Jewish, implored lawmakers to remember what gave rise to Nazism in Germany nearly a century ago.\\n“If we don’t want to repeat history,” Pritzker said, “then for God’s sake in this moment we better be strong enough to learn from it.”\\nAssociated Press writers John O’Connor in Springfield, Illinois, and Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report.\\nOriginally Published: March 1, 2025 at 11:58 AM CST\\nShare this:\\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nGov.

He has left no room for compromise. Democrats need to embrace that.\\nSara Pequeño\\nUSA TODAY\\nHear this story\\nThe Democrats might be finding their voice in a political world where MAGA runs the government. It took them long enough.\\nAt a meeting of the country’s governors at the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump singled out Maine Gov. Janet Mills during remarks about an executive order he signed this month that bans trans girls and women from competing in female sports.\\nMaine has a law that bars discrimination based on gender identity and continues to allow trans girls to compete in high school athletics.\\n“You\\'d better comply,” Trump told the Democratic governor, referencing the executive order. “Otherwise, you’re not getting any federal funding.”\\n“We’ll see you in court,” Mills responded, apparently striking a nerve.\\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\\n“Good, I’ll see you in court,” Trump replied. “I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one. And enjoy your life after governor because I don’t think you’ll be elected in politics.”\\nMills is a former state attorney general, she knows what she\\'s talking about. She isn\\'t just threatening legal action to go viral. She intends to follow through with it. She also probably knows how to handle a bully openly threatening to withhold federal funding if he doesn\\'t get his way.\\nFinally, someone is challenging Trump to his face when he tries to be a tough guy. This should be the standard for every Democratic politician in the United States.\\nClearly, we are past the point of passive-aggressive eye rolls and complaining on X (formerly Twitter). I understand that the party is at a crossroads: There is no clear leader, and Democrats seem to be is still trying to understand what happened in the presidential election. What is clear, however, is that the party’s constituents are fed up, and Democrats can use this momentum to prepare for the midterm elections.\\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills shows Democrats the way forward\\nMills isn’t the only Democrat stepping up to challenge Trump. There are a handful of other Democrats who seem prepared to meet the moment.\\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., for example, has doubled his following on Instagram since Trump’s election by consistently calling out the president.\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, another shining star among Democrats, has been giving her party a masterclass in social media strategy for years. Most recently, she has used her platform to go head-to-head with \"border czar\" Tom Homan, who criticized her for holding a webinar to teach her constituents about their rights as immigrants.\\nOcasio-Cortez, who lost out on the opportunity to be the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee last year, is someone her party should be elevating.\\nYour Turn:Trump\\'s first month has been devastating. And people voted for all of this. | Opinion Forum\\nWhat\\'s clear is that messaging needs to go beyond social media. Democracy works best when people are engaged, and they are best engaged in person.\\nI hope to see Murphy, Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats speaking at protests, marching in rallies and taking the message offline. Not only will it improve their chances for 2026, it will help repair the party\\'s relationship with everyday Americans in a nonelection year.\\nThe Democrats could also stand to take a page from Sen. Bernie Sanders’ playbook. The independent senator from Vermont has been touring the country, speaking with voters who are dissatisfied with the Democratic Party’s way of doing things.\\nStill, not all Democrats are shining examples of resistance.\\nThe country’s top Democrats, like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, representing solidly blue New York state, could be doing more than offering platitudes and skirting discussion of genuine concerns within the party.\\nOpinion:Trump isn\\'t the \\'king\\' of New York. We don\\'t even like him.\\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, often seen as a 2028 presidential hopeful, has sought to find common ground with the Trump administration.\\nTo me, we are past bipartisanship. When Trump is treating marginalized groups as less than human, there is no room for middle ground. He has left no room for compromise and Democrats need to embrace that. Doing anything else won\\'t work.\\nWaiting for Trump to fail won\\'t work. He\\'s already failing.\\nSome have argued that the best thing for Democrats to do at this time is to let the Trump administration implode on its own.\\nPolitical strategist James Carville wrote an opinion column for The New York Times suggesting as much, saying “only until the Trump administration has spiraled into the low 40s or high 30s in public approval polling percentages should we make like a pack of hyenas and go for the jugular.”\\nI understand the sentiment. I also understand that there is only so much the Democrats can do politically at this moment. However, I disagree with Carville’s take. I would rather the Democrats have a steady drumbeat of anti-Trump words backed by action. Tell him you will see him in court. Call out the cruelty of his administration to his face. Tell Elon Musk to go to hell.\\nBesides, Trump already has a very low approval rating of 45% ‒ \"15 points below the historical average for all other elected presidents in mid-February since 1953,\" according to Gallup ‒ that will likely get lower. It won\\'t matter if Democrats don\\'t mobilize.\\nIt\\'s not like MAGA activist sat idly by while the Biden administration worked to improve the country. They spent the entire four years lying and catastrophizing about everything. It clearly worked out in their favor.\\nIn a matter of days, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a budget to avert a March 14 government shutdown. If all Democrats are in attendance, House Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose maybe a couple of votes.\\nThis will be the perfect test of Democratic fortitude in the face of Trump’s spending cuts, one that they can use to their advantage if they are strong and energized. It’s time for the Democrats to chart a new path forward – they must break from their traditions and decorum and be angry. If democracy is truly at stake, it’s time to act like it.\\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter: @sara__pequeno\\nFeatured Weekly Ad\\nAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Advertiser Acceptance Policy Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices\\nContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local Business\\nNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads YouTube Reddit Flipboard\\n10Best USAT Wine Club Shopping Best-selling Booklist Southern Kitchen Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Home Internet Blueprint\\n© 2025 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.'}, {'title': 'Impeaching Judges: Elon Musk, GOP Threats Are A Risky Political Spectacle - HuffPost', 'image_url': 'https://slideplayer.com/slide/16202428/95/images/9/But+is+presidentialism+really+dangerous+for+new+democracies.jpg', 'raw_content': \"Published Time: 2025-02-28T19:25:33Z\\nMusk, GOP Push To Impeach Judges Is Dangerous 'Theater' | HuffPost Latest News\\nSkip to Main Content\\n×\\nMain Menu\\nU.S. Edition\\nNews\\nU.S. NewsWorld NewsBusinessEnvironmentHealthSocial JusticeCrime\\nPolitics\\nCongressExtremism\\nOpinion\\nEntertainment\\nCulture & ArtsMediaCelebrityTV & FilmBooks\\nLife\\nWellnessTravelTechStyle & BeautyFood & DrinkParentingRelationshipsMoneyHome & LivingWork/LifeShopping\\nVoices\\nBlack VoicesQueer VoicesLatino VoicesIndigenous VoicesAsian VoicesWomen's Voices\\nHuffPost Personal\\nNEW: Games\\nHoroscopes\\nVideo\\nFrom Our Partners\\nMy 5-To-9\\nNewsletters\\nInternational\\nU.S.U.K.EspañaFranceΕλλάδα (Greece)Italia日本 (Japan)한국 (Korea)\\nFollow Us\\nTerms\\xa0|\\xa0Privacy Policy\\nPart of HuffPost News. ©2025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

Lawmakers calling for judicial impeachment are largely making hollow threats, one expert told HuffPost, but these threats are alarming nonetheless.\\nAdvertisement\\nIn over 200 years, just 15 federal judges have been impeached in the United States. Only eight of them were removed from their position; the others were acquitted or saw their charges dismissed.\\nThe grounds for impeachment for a federal judge are high crimes and misdemeanors or treason. Generally speaking, the term “high crimes” is not well-defined, but it usually covers things like fraud, bribery or lying to the government. A federal judge does not have to be the subject of any disciplinary action or complaints before being impeached.\\nIt is up to the discretion of Congress to decide when to draw up articles of impeachment. Once drafted, the House votes on whether to adopt the articles. If they are adopted, the next hurdle is the U.S. Senate, where a two-thirds majority must agree in order to convict and remove the judge.\\nAdvertisement\\nRepublicans currently hold only a slight majority in the Senate, which means the prospect of judicial impeachment or removal is almost entirely a fantasy.\\nAnd yet it keeps coming up.\\nMost recently, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) formally introduced articles to impeach Senior U.S. District Judge John Bates.\\nOn Monday, in a screed on X (formerly Twitter), Ogles called the Washington, D.C.-based jurist, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2001, a “predator” and a “RADICAL LGBTQ activist.”\\nAdvertisement\\nOgles’ ire at Bates stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of physicians and medical professionals known as Doctors for America. They sued the administration over President Donald Trump’s executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate “gender ideology extremism” from their ranks by deleting public-facing information mentioning gender ideology or appearing to reference anything beyond two biological sexes.\\nPart of what was scrubbed included key HIV infection data, including data related to children. Clinical trial data was also taken down, as was information for doctors on how to monitor or respond to disease outbreaks.\\nBates ruled against the Trump administration on Feb. 11, directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and Department of Health and Human Services to temporarily restore data to their webpages. (Bates issued another ruling in the case on Tuesday, and the government has agreed to maintain the sites until further review is completed in March.)\\nAdvertisement\\nIn his initial ruling, he underlined the stakes involved.\\n“If those doctors cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health,” Bates wrote.\\nRepublican Reps. Andrew Clyde (Ga.), Eli Crane (Ariz.) and Derrick Van Orden (Wis.) also have called for judges to be impeached or have filed articles of impeachment, citing abuse of power by way of politicization. None of these lawmakers responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment, including questions about why they believed their articles of impeachment met the criteria of high crimes and misdemeanors.\\nAnd leading the charge for weeks has been Trump’s right-hand man: Musk.\\nWhen U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer for the Southern District of New York stopped the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that Musk helms from running roughshod through the sensitive Treasury Department records earlier this month, Musk bristled in a post: “A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached NOW!”\\nAdvertisement\\nMusk piped up again a few days later, when Clyde called for the impeachment of Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell of Rhode Island, an Obama-era appointee who has been on the bench since 2011. McConnell temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s freeze on federal funding.\\n“Momentum is growing rapidly to impeach activist judges who repeatedly fail to follow the law,” Musk wrote on Feb. 15, alongside photos of both McConnell and Engelmayer.\\nMusk was back at it this week after the administration had another bumpy ride in court and was ordered to release billions in U.S. foreign aid that has been locked up in the freeze.\\nAdvertisement\\n“If ANY judge ANYWHERE can block EVERY Presidential order EVERYWHERE, we do NOT have democracy, we have TYRANNY of the JUDICIARY,” Musk wrote.\\nThe impeachment calls are mostly histrionics, said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Judiciary Program.\\nBut that doesn’t mean there are no potential consequences.\\n“The most important thing to understand about these articles of impeachment is that there is no chance at all that these judges will be removed on these grounds,” Keith said. “This is anti-democratic theater, which is not to say it’s not harmful, it’s just there’s no chance these judges will be removed on these grounds.”\\nAdvertisement\\nLawmakers’ motivation isn’t clear, he said, “especially since they know that they have no chance of success.”\\n“But I do know that we are in a perilous moment for our democracy and that one of the courts’ primary responsibilities is serving as a check on the other branches and what these articles of impeachment ultimately become is a sort of threat against judges,” he said. “It’s hanging over the head of judges who are considering issuing decisions against the executive branch or against Congress.”\\n“No sitting judge wants to have articles of impeachment introduced against them and then go through a Senate trial,” Keith said, even if there’s no chance they’ll be removed.\\nAdvertisement\\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told HuffPost this week that threats of judicial impeachment fit into the broader pictures Republicans are trying to paint about the political landscape.\\n“What’s worrisome is when MAGA decides that anybody who disagrees with them is corrupt, when they start policing the judiciary with fake impeachments designed to intimidate,” Whitehouse said. “I think the most significant thing that the Republicans want to do is to pound a particular narrative home. You know, Trump wasn’t actually a criminal. There was a weaponized thing against him. Climate change is a hoax.”\\n“You know, they’ve got a whole litany of crap, basically, that they sell by repetition,” he added. “I think the noise around an impeachment could very well assist in that political goal of pounding home their false narrative.”\\nAdvertisement\\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), a longtime ally to Trump, said there is no doubt what Republicans would do if they could get the votes.\\n“Obviously we will begin impeachment proceedings if and only if the House passes them,” he said. Lee has also posted on X in support of judicial impeachment.\\nThese calls to impeach and remove are also coming at a time when threats of political violence, including against the judiciary, are on the rise.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe U.S. Marshals Service — which is responsible for protecting 2,700 federal judges and some 30,000 prosecutors and court staff — said threats to judges have doubled in just three years, according to a Reuters report.\\nThree state judges and one federal judge have been killed in the last 24 years. In 2020, the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas was killed and her husband was injured when a gunman posing as a FedEx driver came to her New Jersey home.\\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press\\nThe next four years will change America forever.

Anthony Wallace—AFP/Getty Images\\nIdeas\\nBy Ian Bremmer\\nFebruary 28, 2025 5:00 AM EST\\nIan Bremmer is a foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at TIME. He is the president of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy, and GZERO Media, a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs. He teaches applied geopolitics at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, and his most recent book is The Power of Crisis.\\nSouth Korea’s political crisis continues. After President Yoon Suk-yeol was impeached and arrested following his aborted imposition of martial law last December, the country’s Constitutional Court will now decide his future. Legal experts say Yoon will soon be removed from office and sent to prison.\\nTo complicate things further, the same court will also make a ruling that could disqualify opposition leader Lee Jae-myung from an election he’s currently favored to win—and which would have to take place within 60 days of Yoon’s formal removal from office. Lee is appealing his conviction for election-law violations in 2022, and if two appellate courts affirm it, he will be barred from public office for 10 years. A final ruling is expected next month. Yes, it’s a mess.\\nAnd the soap-opera aspects of the crisis obscure an important reality: South Korea’s foreign policy is about to change dramatically, with major implications for the U.S., China, North Korea, and Japan. Lee, the runner-up in the last election in 2022, is a talented politician who has consolidated support within the center-left Democratic Party of Korea (DP). The ruling conservative People Power Party (PPP) is in disarray and doesn’t appear able to field a heavyweight candidate quickly enough to win.\\nYoon’s government greatly improved the country’s long-troubled relationship with Japan, its former colonial master, and has worked closely with Washington on East Asia security strategy. For now, Lee, running as a centrist, is insisting that the U.S.–South Korea alliance must remain the “rock foundation” of South Korea’s diplomacy, national security, and economic development. But Lee’s persistent criticism of Yoon’s pro-U.S. emphasis suggests friction with the Trump Administration over trade, security cooperation, and engagement with North Korea. Lee has already proposed the creation of a bipartisan committee that would focus on preparation for the “highly likely trade war” with the U.S., signaling a much more confrontational approach to Washington.\\nLee has also called for new diplomatic talks with North Korea to ensure that South Korea isn’t pushed to the side if President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stage new talks. At the first Trump-Kim meetings in 2018 and 2019, former center-left South Korean President Moon Jae-in was excluded.\\nIn a recent foreign policy speech, Lee said little about relations with Japan and China, but here too his intense criticism of Yoon’s engagement with Tokyo signals a different approach. Lee accused Yoon of ignoring the crimes Japan committed against South Korea in the 1930s and ’40s and of bowing and scraping before Japan’s current government. We should also expect Lee will support deeper economic and diplomatic engagement with China. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik, an ally and confidant of Lee’s, visited China in February and met with China’s President Xi Jinping. Woo used the trip to reassure Xi that a DP government in South Korea would privilege better relations with his country, and Xi’s decision to meet with Woo personally signaled just how happy China is to hear this. In the unlikely event that a court blocks Lee’s candidacy, Woo would be a formidable replacement.\\nMeanwhile, Yoon faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection. If convicted, he could face the death penalty, but even a prison sentence will be enough to further enrage pro-Yoon protesters, who rioted in January when he was first arrested. Watching from the sidelines, policy-makers in Washington, Beijing, Tokyo, and Pyongyang are focused on both the dangers and the opportunities that South Korea’s political turmoil will create.\\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\\nInside Elon Musk’s War on Washington\\nMeet the 2025 Women of the Year\\nThe Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\\nWhy Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\\nColman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\\nHow to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\\nCecily Strong on Goober the Clown\\nColumn: The Rise of America’s Broligarchy\\nContact us at letters@time.com\\nTIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

Last year, 122 elementary schools across the country enrolled no new students.\\nMiddle school students jump in the air for a photograph at the National Museum of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, July 10, 2024. c Middle school students jump in the air for a photograph at the National Museum of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, July 10, 2024. c Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press\\nThe impact of decades of intense urbanization was also felt. Rural schools account for 88 percent of those affected, while only a handful of closures will occur metropolitan areas—and none in the capital of Seoul.\\nThere were 20,605 schools nationwide in 2023, according to Education Ministry statistics.\\nThe country experienced a 15 percent rise in marriages last year and a modest baby bump—the first in nine years—this was attributed to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nMeanwhile, the proportion of people aged 65 and older reached 20 percent, officially making South Korea a \"super-aged society.\" This has further raised concerns among policymakers about the impact of its demographic shift on Asia\\'s fourth-largest economy.\\nWhat People Are Saying\\nJung Jae-hoon, professor of social welfare at Seoul Women\\'s University, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: \"Childcare systems are well established now at a society level through government investments, but we still need companies to change to become more family-friendly, which makes it a job half done.\"\\nJoo Hyung-hwan, vice-chairman of the Presidential Committee on Ageing Society and Population Policy, was quoted by local media: \"Rather than putting the policy focus only on how to boost the birthrate, we now need a more comprehensive perspective and to devise solutions such as attracting more foreigners.\"\\nWhat Happens Next\\nSouth Korea is expected to lose even more schools in the coming years as births continue their downward trend.\\nObservers have called for a society-wide effort to reform work culture, including workplace discrimination against women, a factor often cited in decisions to delay or forgo childbirth.\\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial & AI Guidelines\\nTop stories\\nGene Hackman and Wife Found Dead at Home: Reports\\nSupreme Court Grants Trump Request to Halt Lower Court Order on Foreign Aid\\nWho Will Win in Donald Trump and Judiciary\\'s Power Battle?\\nIsraeli Official: Hamas Hands Red Cross Bodies of 4 Hostages Held in Gaza\\nAbout the writer\\nMicah McCartney is a reporter for Newsweek based in Taipei, Taiwan.

JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images\\nWhat To Know\\nAfter the U.S. test-fired a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the North Korean Defense Ministry last week accused the Trump administration of \"provocations threatening the security environment of the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK)\" and warned that it considers \"nuclear deterrence\" to be \"a just and inevitable option.\"\\nIn North Korea on Friday morning local time, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a news release that the \"strategic cruise missile launching drill\" occurred on Wednesday morning in the Yellow Sea, to which it referred as the \"West Sea of Korea.\"\\n\"The purpose of the launching drill was to inform the enemies, who are seriously violating the security environment of the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea and fostering and escalating the confrontation environment, of the KPA\\'s counterattack capability in any space,\" the release states.\\n\"And [show] the readiness of its various nuke operation means, and to demonstrate the reliability of the state nuclear deterrence and make the strategic cruise missile sub-units get adept in fulfilling their sudden firing mission,\" it continues.\\nA short time later, South Korea\\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it had tracked the North Korean missile test and \"maintains readiness to repel any potential provocation by North Korea based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance,\" according to the Associated Press (AP).\\nWhat People Are Saying\\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the White House and the U.S. Department of Defense via email on Thursday night.\\nAccording to KCNA, Kim expressed \"satisfaction over the result of the launching drill\" and \"said that it is a responsible exercise of the DPRK\\'s war deterrence to continuously test the reliability and operation of the components of its nuclear deterrence and demonstrate their might.\"\\n\"What is guaranteed by powerful striking ability is the most perfect deterrence and defense capacity,\" the North Korean leader reportedly added.\\nActing South Korean President Choi Sang-mok said during a recent visit to his country\\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff command control center that \"the military must maintain a readiness posture to make an immediate response to any provocations from North Korea while establishing an unwavering military command structure.\"\\nWhat Happens Next\\nWhile North Korea\\'s military has recently heavily focused on sending troops to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine, the country remains a military threat to South Korea, and potentially a nuclear threat to the U.S.\\nNone of Trump\\'s first-term meetings with Kim resulted in any meaningful concessions from the North Korean leader on his nuclear program. Kim has ignored a recent suggestion by Trump for further discussions, the AP reported.\\nThe Associated Press contributed information for this article.\\nfairness meter\\nfairness meter\\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that\\'s factual and fair.\\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that\\'s factual and fair.\\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\\nClick On Meter To Rate This Article\\nConfirm your selection\\nComment on your rating\\nShare\\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial & AI Guidelines\\nTop stories\\nJeffrey Epstein Files: Attorney General Pam Bondi Releases DOJ Documents\\nTrump Takes Softer Tone on Zelensky Ahead of Friday Visit\\nRepublicans Are Now Trapped by Their Own Budget\\nMap Shows Where ICE is Expanding Immigrant Detention Facilities\\nAbout the writer\\nAila Slisco is a Newsweek night reporter based in New York.

Anthony Wallace—AFP/Getty Images\\nIdeas\\nBy Ian Bremmer\\nFebruary 28, 2025 5:00 AM EST\\nIan Bremmer is a foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at TIME. He is the president of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy, and GZERO Media, a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs. He teaches applied geopolitics at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, and his most recent book is The Power of Crisis.\\nSouth Korea’s political crisis continues. After President Yoon Suk-yeol was impeached and arrested following his aborted imposition of martial law last December, the country’s Constitutional Court will now decide his future. Legal experts say Yoon will soon be removed from office and sent to prison.\\nTo complicate things further, the same court will also make a ruling that could disqualify opposition leader Lee Jae-myung from an election he’s currently favored to win—and which would have to take place within 60 days of Yoon’s formal removal from office. Lee is appealing his conviction for election-law violations in 2022, and if two appellate courts affirm it, he will be barred from public office for 10 years. A final ruling is expected next month. Yes, it’s a mess.\\nAnd the soap-opera aspects of the crisis obscure an important reality: South Korea’s foreign policy is about to change dramatically, with major implications for the U.S., China, North Korea, and Japan. Lee, the runner-up in the last election in 2022, is a talented politician who has consolidated support within the center-left Democratic Party of Korea (DP). The ruling conservative People Power Party (PPP) is in disarray and doesn’t appear able to field a heavyweight candidate quickly enough to win.\\nYoon’s government greatly improved the country’s long-troubled relationship with Japan, its former colonial master, and has worked closely with Washington on East Asia security strategy. For now, Lee, running as a centrist, is insisting that the U.S.–South Korea alliance must remain the “rock foundation” of South Korea’s diplomacy, national security, and economic development. But Lee’s persistent criticism of Yoon’s pro-U.S. emphasis suggests friction with the Trump Administration over trade, security cooperation, and engagement with North Korea. Lee has already proposed the creation of a bipartisan committee that would focus on preparation for the “highly likely trade war” with the U.S., signaling a much more confrontational approach to Washington.\\nLee has also called for new diplomatic talks with North Korea to ensure that South Korea isn’t pushed to the side if President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stage new talks. At the first Trump-Kim meetings in 2018 and 2019, former center-left South Korean President Moon Jae-in was excluded.\\nIn a recent foreign policy speech, Lee said little about relations with Japan and China, but here too his intense criticism of Yoon’s engagement with Tokyo signals a different approach. Lee accused Yoon of ignoring the crimes Japan committed against South Korea in the 1930s and ’40s and of bowing and scraping before Japan’s current government. We should also expect Lee will support deeper economic and diplomatic engagement with China. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik, an ally and confidant of Lee’s, visited China in February and met with China’s President Xi Jinping. Woo used the trip to reassure Xi that a DP government in South Korea would privilege better relations with his country, and Xi’s decision to meet with Woo personally signaled just how happy China is to hear this. In the unlikely event that a court blocks Lee’s candidacy, Woo would be a formidable replacement.\\nMeanwhile, Yoon faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection. If convicted, he could face the death penalty, but even a prison sentence will be enough to further enrage pro-Yoon protesters, who rioted in January when he was first arrested. Watching from the sidelines, policy-makers in Washington, Beijing, Tokyo, and Pyongyang are focused on both the dangers and the opportunities that South Korea’s political turmoil will create.\\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\\nInside Elon Musk’s War on Washington\\nMeet the 2025 Women of the Year\\nThe Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\\nWhy Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\\nColman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\\nHow to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\\nCecily Strong on Goober the Clown\\nColumn: The Rise of America’s Broligarchy\\nContact us at letters@time.com\\nTIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

As the nation\\'s political fate hangs in the balance, hundreds of thousands of citizens are expected to gather for demonstrations in the heart of Seoul.

(Source: Ahn Young-joon/AP)*\\n\\nDemonstrators are chanting slogans like \"Remove Yoon Suk-yeol,\" seeking to represent the will of the people. This surge of mobilization is likely to have a significant impact on President Yoon\\'s political future and the governance of the country. Recent polls indicate strong public support for his impeachment, with many citizens calling for new elections.\\n\\n![윤석열 지지 집회](https://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/South-Korea-Martial-Law/43f8d1c9b5a045338a8be4f5f21fb9a4/2/0)  \\n*While there are supporters for President Yoon, their numbers are relatively small. (Source: Ahn Young-joon/AP)*\\n\\nIn contrast, a smaller faction of demonstrators—aligned with the president—has been rallying under the banner \"Protect Yoon Suk-yeol.\" These supporters argue that his policies are necessary for the government and assert that the impeachment process is driven by political conspiracies.\\n\\nThe public sentiment is sharply divided, escalating the political tensions in the country. Survey results reveal that a majority of citizens support the impeachment, reflecting a critical and complex moment in South Korean politics.\\n\\nThis situation embodies the uncertainty that the public feels regarding future political decisions.
